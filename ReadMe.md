# Data Structures in Java

This repository contains comprehensive notes and implementations of various data structures using Java. It serves as a learning resource and reference guide for understanding fundamental data structures and their applications. The content is based on Apni Kaksha Alpha course and PW Skills free YouTube lectures, providing a structured learning path with practice questions ranging from easy to hard difficulty levels.

## Overview

Each chapter focuses on a specific data structure with detailed explanations and implementations. Small notes accompany each section to enhance understanding of key concepts and techniques. The repository includes in-depth code explanations and a variety of practice problems to strengthen your understanding.
