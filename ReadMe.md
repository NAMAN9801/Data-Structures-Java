# Data Structures in Java

This repository contains comprehensive notes and implementations of various data structures using Java. It serves as a learning resource and reference guide for understanding fundamental data structures and their applications.

## Overview

Each chapter focuses on a specific data structure with detailed explanations and implementations. Small notes accompany each section to enhance understanding of key concepts and techniques.

## Contents

- **Arrays**: Implementation, manipulation, and common operations on arrays
- **Divide and Conquer**: Problem-solving techniques and algorithm designs
- **Functions**: Implementation patterns, parameters, return types, and best practices
- **Loops**: Different looping constructs, iteration patterns, and optimizations
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation
- **Patterns**: Common design patterns and algorithmic patterns in Java
- **Recursion**: Recursive algorithms, backtracking, and recursive data structures
- **Sorting**: Implementation of various sorting algorithms and their analyses
- **Strings**: String manipulation, searching, and pattern matching algorithms

## Structure

Each chapter includes:
- Theoretical explanation of the data structure
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Java implementation with comments
- Example applications
- Practice problems and solutions
- Quick reference notes for revision
